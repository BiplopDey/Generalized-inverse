# Pseudoinverse

## Abstract
When we use linear regressition, we have to inverse a matrix that depend on our dessign matrix, but it could happen that this matrix is not intersible.
If your are using a library it handles it using a pseudoinverse. But there are families of inverses that can be choosen, in this paper i will go throw rigirously 
to the most important ones and why pseudoinverse is the optimal option, in therms of computation and interpretation of the linear regression.
